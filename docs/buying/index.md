# Buying at Armstrong Creek

As a relatively new suburb, until recently construction of new dwellings was the best option to move into the Armstrong Creek area with few existing houses available for purchase. 

However, now that there are more established estates, purchasing a house has also become a more feasible option. The median house price is around $478,000 according to Realestate.com.au[^1].

##Land Estates
There are a number of estates selling land within the high growth area including:

- [Armstrong Villawood](http://armstrong.villawoodproperties.com.au)
- [Warralily](http://warralily.com.au)
- [Ashbury](http://ashburyestate.com.au)
- [Watermark](http://watermarkgeelong.com.au)

Of the estates, Armstrong Villawood and Warralily are the most advanced with both now having established regions within their estates.
