# About Armstrong Creek

##Suburb overview

Armstrong Creek is a relatively new suburb, having been officially gazetted in February 2012. The area resides on farming land that previously was part of nearby Mount Duneed and Connewarre.

The area will be the source of major growth for the Greater Geelong area in the years ahead, and as such is the focus of many major infrastructure and facility investments.
